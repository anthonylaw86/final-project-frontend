# Beat App

The idea of this site is a place for users to add their favorite songs while listening to Spotify. A premium spotify account is needed to access the music player.

Everything has been seperated out into components & all modals pull from a main "ModalWithForm" component making things clean & easily reusable.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
