            Hey friends, my name is Anthony Law & I'm a full stack software
            engineer. My current coding languages include React, JavaScript,
            HTML, CSS, Node, & Express.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>My work history was in the hospitality industry, lastly as
            a bar manager, and about a year or more ago I decided to leave & try
            something new. I started learning to code at TripleTen bootcamp.
            Where I've learned thorough theory and project's how to handle a
            different number of programming tasks. I'm looking to hone my skills
            further as well as perfect & build upon my current knowledge. I'd
            love to work with you.
